UgxTBbUy8CQ_8tQESpl4AaABAg,Besides speeding the other thing that would help cross overs crashes would be cement dividers and get ride of the metal ropes that TXDOT thinks will stop a vehicle.,4,,@SM0R3S,2 days ago,0,UCaWUjYGpPSVDGAfq2XTkC1w,@SM0R3S,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_m2m-OD-USo2NPwQq529-UEDphOXa3vRCOQPPu5gpsEsg=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,t6Q16VBLX7M,2024-12-19 21:16:01.335149-07:00,Thursday,21

UgwOrEK09BfHk7e_5W94AaABAg,Citations can be given left & right like hotcakes. But people need to take it seriously and be accountable for their actions. What about harsher regulations? DUI is also still a big issue in Houston. Distracted drivers on their phones is a big issue. Speeding is a big issue.,2,,@datb0imarn3,2 days ago,0,UCFU4H5ud7B4UjKt-7TMTXQQ,@datb0imarn3,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kWck1yX-WbzkAj-x_uZIdNhhAt-iWH5XlCLd22T-l3pw=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,False,t6Q16VBLX7M,2024-12-19 21:16:01.335170-07:00,Thursday,21
Ugy5iPDNYkHX6twhi9B4AaABAg,Well for crying out loud.  Im doing 70 to 75 and everyone is passing me up like im sitting still. They have to be doing 85 to 95 miles an hour even a 100. Im like people slow down please. Everyone is in such a hurry. Stop please üôè üò¢ üòí üòî üò™ please. This is ridiculous. People die from this. Go 70 to 75.
