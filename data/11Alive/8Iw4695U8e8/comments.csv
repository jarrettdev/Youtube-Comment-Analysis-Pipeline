UgzS6XRLACDv4JyKsAd4AaABAg,"WASHINGTON & LINCOLNâ€™S DAYS OF SNOW **
That blue gold called water with which we are blessed
As raindrops or crystallized snow
Changes to rivers and fresh water lakes
While the winds of our seasons blow.

Winterâ€™s cold days are dreary and often cruel
But their hardships are used by God as a tool.
His reasons for seasons fit His grand plan
To strengthen the souls of both woman and man.

The cold winds of winter play tunes with the trees
Though now they sound different when stripped of their leaves.
Our warm days have gone and for spring we must wait
And all who are weary pray it won't be too late.

The snow has piled high on the rooftops of town
As small birds huddle in the bushes theyâ€™ve found.
Everywhere are snowmen standing as guards
While children throw snowballs from forts in their yards.

If Washington and Lincoln were alive and well
And spoke of Americaâ€™s winters in their day.
I wonder what they might faithfully convey 
And would we glad itâ€™s not then but today?
